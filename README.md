# The Hexagonal Online Store
Your favorite one-stop shop for things you don't need: your first visit will be the last one. ðŸ˜†

If you wish to test it, please let me know at fernando.mashimo@gmail.com and I will provide access.

**UPDATE March 17th, 2025:** Set a more readable, human-friendly custom domain for the API.

**UPDATE March 15th, 2025:** Added API Gateway stack and deployed application at AWS.


*Notes:*
- Application is under construction, as of March, 2025.
- About Hexagonal Architecture: I'm aware it is too over-engineered for an application of this size - just wanted to keep practicing coding patterns and share it.
